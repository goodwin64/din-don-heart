# About
"Din-don" is a free web application that provides you the actual info about your heart state based on its' ECG.
For more details, please, proceed to the [demo](https://goodwin64.github.io/din-don-heart/) page.

# Example
Having a raw ECG plot:
![ECG before](public/ECG-1.jpg "Before analysing")

after analysis it looks something like:
